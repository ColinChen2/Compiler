# Compiler
create a compiler(interpreter) step by step

In order to know more about compile, I look up some video and book, But I find a good blog.
Good job!

Thanks for [Ruslans'blog](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/).

All in the blog use Python to code. However, I prefer to use js and That's what we do now.

## RUN
every part of the code in Build-A-Interpreter can be run.
example:

```javascript
node Build-A-Interpreter/chapter1/part4.js "2*3*4/2"
```

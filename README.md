# Compiler
Create a compiler(interpreter) step by step

In order to know more about compile, I look up some video and book, after read them. I don't think understand totally. At the same time, I find a good blog.
It's great example, Good job!

Thanks for [Ruslans'blog](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/).

All in the blog use Python to code. However, I prefer to use js and That's what we do now.

## RUN
every part of the code interpreter can be run.

In chapter1
```javascript
node interpreter/chapter1/part4.js "2*3*4/2"
```

In chapter2
```
npm install
npm start
